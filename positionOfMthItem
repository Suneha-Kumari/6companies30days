M items are to be delivered in a circle of size N. Find the position where the M-th item will be delivered if we start from a given position K. Note that items are distributed at adjacent positions starting from K.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, M = 2, K = 1
Output:
2
Explanation:
If we start from 1st position, the
2nd item will land at the 2nd position.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5, M = 8, K = 2
Output:
4
Explanation:
If we start from 2nd position, the
8th item will land at the 4th position.

solution:
int findPosition(int N , int M , int K) {
        // code here
     if(N==1)
     return 1;
     return ((M+K-1)%N==0?N:(M+K-1)%N);
    }
